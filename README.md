## Notes

```
- This was the first project that I have done by react-query and tailwind and it maybe doesn't have the best form and performance
- I had to change some data and data structure
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
